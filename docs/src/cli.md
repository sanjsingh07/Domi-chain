title: Command-line Guide
---

In this section, we will describe how to use the Analog command-line tools to
create a _wallet_, to send and receive ANLOG tokens, and to participate in
the cluster by delegating stake.

To interact with a Analog cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also
known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it is the first place the
Analog core team deploys new functionality. The command-line interface is not
necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and
secure access to your Analog accounts.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Analog Command Line (CLI) tools:

- [Install the Analog Tools](cli/install-analog-cli-tools.md)
