# Analog Program

Use the Analog Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [Analog SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/analog-sdk) instead.

More information about Analog is available in the [Analog documentation](https://docs.analog.com/).

[Helloworld](https://github.com/analog-labs/example-helloworld) and the [Analog Program Library](https://github.com/analog-labs/analog-program-library) provide examples of how to use this crate.
