# Analog SDK

Use the Analog SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Analog Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/analog-program) instead.

More information about Analog is available in the [Analog documentation](https://docs.analog.com/).

The [Analog Program Library](https://github.com/analog/testnet-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
